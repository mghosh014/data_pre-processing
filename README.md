# Data pre-processing for computed tomography on FPGA


# Disclaimer
This is an academic master's course integrated project done at Otto von Guericke University, Germany. Without permission, this code should not be used for any kind of personal or industrial work.

# What is done by myself
In this file, I develloped a software envirnment to evaluate the data pre-processing for different data type precision. For instance, floating point precision and arbitary fixed point precision.
